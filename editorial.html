        <div class="text">There’s something almost ancient in the way Africa cooks. <br>
          It’s not just about fire and spice, though, let’s be honest, the spice is everything, it’s about rhythm.
About tradition passed hand to hand, pot to pot, mother to daughter, village to city. <br>
Whether it’s smoky jollof bubbling at a street corner in Lagos, injera soaking up flavor in an Ethiopian home, or a slow-cooked tagine kissed by Moroccan sun, Africa doesn’t just feed you. <br>
It teaches you patience, boldness, and the sacred art of seasoning with your soul. 
This is not cuisine that whispers. It sings — loud, proud, and irresistibly delicious.

        <div class="text">Asia doesn’t follow a recipe it writes poetry in steam, umami, and twenty-something ingredients tossed
           into a wok at lightning speed. You haven’t truly lived until you’ve slurped noodles on a rainy Tokyo night or
          dipped your fingers into warm biryani in a bustling Indian home. Here, food is ceremony, chaos, and comfort
         all at once. 
         From Thai street vendors to Korean grandmothers, from the delicate art of sushi to the fiery glory
        of Sichuan peppercorns, Asia takes your taste buds on a trip no passport needed. Just bring your appetite. <br>
        And maybe a cold drink.</div>

        <div class="text">Europe is like that elegant friend who somehow always has good wine and better stories. Its food?
          Effortlessly charming. French kitchens whisper secrets, Italian nonnas hug you with pasta, and Spanish tapas
          flirt with your taste buds like a summer romance. But it’s not all fancy cutlery and tablecloths, sometimes
          it’s just a baguette, cheese, and the kind of butter that makes you emotional. From hearty Balkan stews to
          Nordic simplicity, Europe reminds us that cooking can be both an art and a deeply human act.

      <div class="north-america">
        <div class="text">North America is a melting pot <br>and not just metaphorically.<br>
          his continent throws a little bit of everywhere into its pot and stirs like it means it.  <br>
          You’ve got Southern barbecue that feels like a warm hug and a history lesson, <br>
           New York bagels with attitude, and tacos that speak more truth than most people. <br>
           Indigenous flavors, immigrant flavors, diner flavors <br>
           it’s all here, unapologetically bold and deeply personal. <br>
           North American cuisine says: “Come as you are. But bring hot sauce.”<br>
            And honestly? We’re here for it.

        <div class="text">South America cooks with a kind of wild beauty <br>
          the kind that makes you close your eyes mid-bite.   It’s smoky grills in Argentina, <br>
        golden arepas in Venezuela, ceviche so fresh it still tastes like ocean. <br>
          in every corner,corn in every shape, fruits you’ve never heard of (but now dream about),  <br>
          and enough rhythm in a Brazilian kitchen to start a street party. <br>
        his is a continent that feels deeply, eats joyfully, and always makes <br>
         room for seconds. Maybe thirds.</div>
